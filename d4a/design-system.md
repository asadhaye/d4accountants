# UI/UX Consistency Analysis

After analyzing the codebase, I've identified the following inconsistencies in the UI/UX:

## 1. Inconsistent Button Styling
- The `premium` variant in button.tsx uses a gradient style that doesn't match the `btn-gradient` class in globals.css
- Need to standardize gradient styling across the application

## 2. Missing Glass Effect Definitions
- Components in components.css reference `glass` and `glass-card` classes
- The `glass` class is defined in globals.css but `glass-card` isn't properly defined anywhere

## 3. Inconsistent Component Styling
- Some components use direct Tailwind classes while others use pre-defined CSS classes
- Need to standardize approach for better maintainability

## 4. Proposed Changes
1. Standardize button variants
2. Create proper glass effect definitions
3. Update component styling to use consistent patterns
4. Ensure color palette is used consistently throughout
