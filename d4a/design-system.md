# D4 Accountants Design System

## Current Implementation

### Colors
- Primary: Blue (#0ea5e9) with shades 50-950
- Secondary: Teal (#14b8a6) with shades 50-950
- Semantic colors for states (success, warning, error, info)
- Neutral colors for text and backgrounds

### Typography
- Font Family: Inter (var(--font-inter))
- Consistent text sizes (xs to 5xl)
- Font weights from light to bold

### Component Styles
- Buttons use consistent gradient and hover states
- Glass effect standardization across components
- Consistent navigation styling
- Proper spacing and padding

## Improvements Made

### 1. Design Tokens Implementation
- Created `design-system.ts` with typed tokens
- Organized colors, typography, spacing, and animations
- Added proper TypeScript types for better IDE support

### 2. Component Consistency
- Standardized button variants
- Implemented consistent glass effects
- Added proper skeleton loading states
- Enhanced error boundaries with consistent styling

### 3. Animation System
- Defined standard durations and timing functions
- Added GPU acceleration for better performance
- Implemented reduced motion preferences

### 4. Loading States
- Created reusable skeleton components
- Maintained layout stability during loading
- Added proper loading animations

### 5. Error Handling
- Implemented consistent error boundaries
- Added user-friendly error messages
- Included recovery actions

## Next Steps

1. **Component Library**
   - Document all available components
   - Add usage examples
   - Include accessibility guidelines

2. **Theme Customization**
   - Enhance dark/light mode support
   - Add more theme variables
   - Improve color contrast

3. **Performance**
   - Monitor animation performance
   - Optimize loading states
   - Reduce bundle size

4. **Accessibility**
   - Add ARIA labels
   - Improve keyboard navigation
   - Enhance screen reader support

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Using Design Tokens**
   ```typescript
   import { colors, typography, spacing } from '@/lib/styles/design-system';
   ```

2. **Component Best Practices**
   - Use semantic HTML
   - Follow accessibility guidelines
   - Implement proper loading states
   - Handle errors gracefully

3. **Animation Guidelines**
   - Use GPU-accelerated properties
   - Respect user preferences
   - Keep animations subtle and purposeful

4. **Responsive Design**
   - Follow mobile-first approach
   - Use consistent breakpoints
   - Maintain layout stability
