# UI/UX Consistency Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Unified Button Styling
- Standardized `premium` button variant to use the `btn-gradient` class
- Updated `btn-gradient` to have consistent styling with proper transitions and colors
- Made `cta-button` inherit from `btn-gradient` for consistency

### 2. Glass Effect Standardization
- Added proper `glass-card` class definition that was missing
- Ensured all components using glass effects reference the same base styles
- Applied proper rounded corners and padding for glass card components

### 3. Navigation Link Consistency
- Added a `nav-link` class in globals.css to standardize navigation styling
- Updated navigation links in Header.tsx to use this class
- Ensured consistent hover and active states

### 4. Color System Organization
- Created a theme.css file with CSS variables for color values
- Organized colors into primary, accent, and gradient categories
- Added comments to improve code readability and maintainability

### 5. Component Structure
- Added comments in globals.css to better organize component classes
- Ensured consistent transition effects and hover states across components
- Made sure all components follow the same styling patterns

## Next Steps

To further improve UI/UX consistency:

1. Consider converting remaining inline Tailwind classes to component classes
2. Create a component library documentation for the team
3. Implement design tokens for spacing, typography, and shadows
4. Add more theme variables for dark/light mode consistency
