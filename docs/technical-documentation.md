# D4 Accountants Technical Documentation

## Architecture Overview

The D4 Accountants website is built using Next.js 13+ with App Router, incorporating modern web development practices and technologies.

### Core Technologies

- **Next.js 13+**: Frontend framework with App Router
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe code
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling
- **Framer Motion**: For animations
- **Shadcn UI**: For UI components

## Component Architecture

### UI Components

#### Button Component

- Implements various variants (default, destructive, outline, etc.)
- Supports different sizes (default, sm, lg, icon)
- Includes hover and tap animations

#### ChatBot Component

- Floating chat interface
- Real-time messaging capabilities
- Responsive design with mobile optimization
- Animated transitions for open/close states

#### LeadCaptureForm Component

- Form validation using Zod
- Service-specific customization
- Animated form fields
- Toast notifications for feedback

### Animation System

Implemented using Framer Motion with predefined variants:

```typescript
- fadeIn: Basic fade in animation
- slideUp: Slide up with fade effect
- scaleUp: Scale up with fade effect
- staggerContainer: Stagger children animations
- cardHover: Card hover effects
- buttonHover: Button hover and tap effects
- pageTransition: Page transition effects
- formField: Form field animations
- chatMessage: Chat message animations
- reducedMotion: Accessibility-focused animations
```

### Responsive Design

Implements a mobile-first approach with breakpoints:

- Mobile: Default styles
- Tablet: md (768px)
- Desktop: lg (1024px)

### Service Pages Structure

Service pages are organized under `/services` directory:

- `/services/tax-planning`
- `/services/bookkeeping`
- `/services/financial-advisory`

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Image Optimization**

   - Using Next.js Image component
   - Proper image sizing and formats
   - Lazy loading implementation

2. **Component Loading**
   - Client-side components marked with 'use client'
   - Server-side rendering where applicable

### Security Measures

1. **Form Security**

   - Input validation using Zod
   - CSRF protection
   - Rate limiting on API routes

2. **API Security**
   - Protected API routes
   - Request validation
   - Error handling

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use functional components
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow the component-first architecture

### State Management
